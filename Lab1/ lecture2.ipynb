Its purpose is to clarify the source code and make it easier for people to follow along with what is happening. Anything in a comment is generally ignored when the code is actually run, making comments useful for including explanations and reasoning as well as removing specific lines of code that you may be unsure about. Comments in Python are created by using the pound symbol (`# Insert Text Here`).
